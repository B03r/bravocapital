# fagroupa
Group A!

###Tasks:
(3 out of 10): The group presentation -> DONE!

(2 out of 10):

  (1 out of 10) github account created with your code inside -> DONE!
  
  (1 out of 10) pip install correctly -> DONE!
  
(5 out of 10)

  One task from: A.1 or A.2 or A.3
  
    A.1) Automated Data Cleaning; -> DONE!
    
  One task from: A.4.1 or A.4.2 or A.4.3
  
    A.4.1) Automated Dummy Creation and Transformation with Automated Supervised Binning. -> DONE!
    
  One task from: A.5 or A.6 or A.7 or A.8
  
    A.5) Automated variables and ratios creation using Principal Component and Decision Trees. -> DONE!
    
  One task from: H.1 or H.2 or H.3
  
    Human assisted Data Cleaning -> DONE!
    
  One task from: H.4 or H.5 or H.6
  
    Human assisted method picking -> DONE!
    

All your code should be vectorized (do fast calculations when using pandas data frame [-0.5 points for each method that is not]). -> DONE!
0.5 bonus points: Your group may get an extra 0.5 points if ALL of your algorithm harness the power of multiple-core CPUs -> Almost done for all methods. Not all methods from sklearn can be parallelized, the ones which allow this option have been set to the n_jobs=-1 which will force the library to use as many cores as possible during training. 

Please use the two datasets from exercise 1 and 2 to test your code, because those will be the onces I will use to test.
The package has used the specific tables of the exercises and due to the fact that some have been done specifically for the CSV format, the fiel used shoudl be the one described in the getstated script. 

### Install and setup
In order to install this package use the following command in your terminal: *sudo pip install fagroupa*
